Find occurrences of entity in body; for our purpose an exact case-insensitive match between a word in the body attribute and an entity name is considered a match.
Check for nearby sentiment words, where nearby means |position-of-entity - position-of-sentiment-word| <= 5
We consider the sentiment associated with an entity occurrence as positive (+1) if a positive sentiment word is nearby, negative (-1) if a negative sentiment word is nearby; an entity occurrence could be tagged as both positive and negative.  If neither, we consider the sentiment as neutral (0). 
Your goal is to find the aggregate sentiment per entity group by (source_name, year_month, entity, sentiment_type) as follows:

    NOTE: you are not allowed to use Spark SQL for this assignment
    Read the sentiment word files and the entity names file into Java data structure such as HashSet<String>.  Each line of the input files has a single word.  The data structures will be automatically shared with all copies of your program when it is run in parallel.
    Create dataset<row> with fields
    (source_name, year_month, entity, sentiment)  where sentiment can be -1, 0 or +1
    Then get count group by (source_name, year_month, entity, sentiment)  -- raw sentiment count
      output:   (source_name, year_month, entity, sentiment, count)
    from above find for each source, year_month, entity:
    Overall sentiment:  sum (sentiment*count)
    Overall support:     sum(count).
    Now filter out all supports < 5
    Output to a file (source_name, year_month, entity, overall_sentiment) tuples in decreasing order of absolute value of overall_sentiment
